game.py is made by chatgpt

dont zoom in the browser!!!!!!!
anti aliasing issues

on my laptop at 1920 x 1080
at 200% zoom the tiles are 32 px

grid_data makes nested list for box values

get_neighbours() gives list of 8 surround boxes -
yet to make a case for error for edge boxes

idk wht PIL.Image is doing but it's working

now we gotta start with the human type algorithm

also maybe copy the html code of the game to run locally
